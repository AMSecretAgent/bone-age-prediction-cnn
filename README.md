# Bone Age Prediction from X-Ray Images Using CNN


This project focuses on predicting human age from bone X-ray images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Overview
- Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to estimate age from bone X-ray images.
- The model was trained and evaluated on preprocessed medical imaging data.
- This project was completed as part of a deep learning internship.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Google Colab

## Work Done
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- CNN model design and training
- Model evaluation and prediction analysis

## Notes
This repository contains the training notebook used for experimentation and learning purposes.
